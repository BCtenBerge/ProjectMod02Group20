In this directory, a zip file of all MATLAB code used for the project in module 2 for group 20 can be found. 

Once this zip is extracted, there are three main codes; 
- 'PropertiesAndTS', in this code one can find the calculation for all properties and the code behind the T-s diagram.
- 'SankeyDiagram', in this code one can find the code behind the Sankey diagram.
- 'GrassmanDiagram', in this code on can find the code behind the Grassman diagram.

All code is self-made, except for two function files 'XSteam & GasProperties' (Magnus Holmgren)  and 'plotFlowDiagrams' (Jos Havinga).
